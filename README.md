# prom2teams

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/idealista/prom2teams/master/assets/example.png" alt="Alert example" style="width: 600px;"/>

**prom2teams** is a Web server built with Python that receives alert notifications from a previously configured [Prometheus Alertmanager](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager) instance and forwards it to [Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/) using defined connectors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The application has been tested with _Prometheus 1.7.1_, _Python 3.5.0_ and _pip 9.0.1_.

Newer versions of _Prometheus/Python/pip_ should work but could also present issues.

### Installing

prom2teams is present on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/prom2teams), so could be installed using pip3:

```bash
$ pip3 install prom2teams
```

**Note:** Only works since v1.1.1

## Usage

**Important:** Config path must be provided with at least one Microsoft Teams Connector. Check the options to know how you can supply it.

```bash
# To start the server (config file path , group alerts by, log file path, log level and Jinja2 template path are optional arguments):
$ prom2teams [--configpath <config file path>] [--groupalertsby ("name"|"description"|"instance"|"severity"|"status"|"summary")] [--logfilepath <log file path>] [--loglevel (DEBUG|INFO|WARNING|ERROR|CRITICAL)] [--templatepath <Jinja2 template file path>]

# To show the help message:
$ prom2teams --help
```

Another options to start the service are:

```bash
export APP_CONFIG_FILE=<config file path>
$ prom2teams
```

### Docker image

Every new Prom2teams release, a new Docker image is built in our [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/idealista/). We strongly recommend you to use the images with the version tag, though it will be possible to use them without it.

There are two things you need to bear in mind when creating a Prom2teams container:

- The connector URL must be passed as the environment variable `PROM2TEAMS_CONNECTOR`
- You need to map container's Prom2teams port to one on your host.

So a sample Docker run command would be:
```bash
$ docker run -it -d -e PROM2TEAMS_CONNECTOR="CONNECTOR_URL" -p 8089:8089 idealista/prom2teams:VERSION
```

### Production

For production environments you should prefer using a WSGI server. [uWSGI](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
dependency is installed for an easy usage. Some considerations must be taken to use it:

The binary `prom2teams_uwsgi` launches the app using the uwsgi server. Due to some incompatibilities with [wheel](https://github.com/pypa/wheel)
you must install `prom2teams` using `sudo pip install --no-binary :all: prom2teams` (https://github.com/pypa/wheel/issues/92)

```bash
$ prom2teams_uwsgi <path to uwsgi ini config>
```

And `uwsgi` would look like:

```
[uwsgi]
master = true
processes = 5
#socket = 0.0.0.0:8001
#protocol = http
socket = /tmp/prom2teams.sock
chmod-socket = 777
vacuum = true
env = APP_ENVIRONMENT=pro
env = APP_CONFIG_FILE=/etc/default/prom2teams.ini
```

Consider not provide `chdir` property neither `module` property.

Also you can set the `module` file, by doing a symbolic link: `sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/etc/prom2teams/ && sudo ln -sf /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/usr/local/etc/prom2teams/wsgi.py /usr/local/etc/prom2teams/wsgi.py` (check your dist-packages folder)

Another approach is to provide yourself the `module` file [module example](bin/wsgi.py) and the `bin` uwsgi call [uwsgi example](bin/prom2teams_uwsgi)

**Note:** default log level is DEBUG. Messages are redirected to stdout. To enable file log, set the env APP_ENVIRONMENT=(pro|pre)


### Config file

The config file is an [INI file](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#supported-ini-file-structure) and should have the structure described below:

```
[Microsoft Teams]
# At least one connector is required here
Connector: <webhook url>
AnotherConnector: <webhook url>   
...

[HTTP Server]
Host: <host ip> # default: localhost
Port: <host port> # default: 8089

[Log]
Level: <loglevel (DEBUG|INFO|WARNING|ERROR|CRITICAL)> # default: DEBUG
Path: <log file path>  # default: /var/log/prom2teams/prom2teams.log

[Template]
Path: <Jinja2 template path> # default: app resources template
```

### Configuring Prometheus

The [webhook receiver](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/configuration/#<webhook_config>) in Prometheus allows configuring a prom2teams server.

The url is formed by the host and port defined in the previous step.

**Note:** In order to keep compatibility with previous versions, v2.0 keep attending the default connector ("Connector") in the endpoint 0.0.0.0:8089. This will be removed in future versions.   

```
// The prom2teams endpoint to send HTTP POST requests to.
url: 0.0.0.0:8089/v2/<Connector1>
```

### Templating

prom2teams provides a [default template](prom2teams/resources/templates/teams.j2) built with [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/) to render messages in Microsoft Teams. This template could be overrided using the 'templatepath' argument ('--templatepath <Jinja2 template file path>') during the application start.

Some fields are considered mandatory when received from Alert Manager.
If such a field is not included a default value of 'unknown' is assigned as described below:

Other optional fields are skipped and not included in the Teams message.

#### Swagger UI

Accessing to `<Host>:<Port>` (e.g. `localhost:8089`) in a web browser shows the API v1 documentation.

Accessing to `<Host>:<Port>/v2` (e.g. `localhost:8089/v2`) in a web browser shows the API v2 documentation.

## Testing

To run the test suite you should type the following:

```bash
// After cloning prom2teams :)
$ python3 -m unittest discover tests
```
